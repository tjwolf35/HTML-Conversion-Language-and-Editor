# HTML Conversion Language and Editor
HCL or HTML Conversion Language is a project. HCL is an attempt to create a new, easy to learn, accessible language that will convert simple instructions into pieces of HTML. HCL will change the way that you create websites.

# How does HCL Work?
HCL works by using a function similar to auto correct, for every HCL line written, it will automatically convert that to the appropiate matching html line.

# HCL Samples

# HCL -> HTML
bold heading "Text" -> <h><b>Text</b></h>
paragraph "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." -> <p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
image "imagesource.com" -> <img src=imagesource.com>
