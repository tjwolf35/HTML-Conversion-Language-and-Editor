# HTML Conversion Language and Editor
HCL or HTML Conversion Language is a project. HCL is an attempt to create a new, easy to learn, accessible language that will convert simple instructions into pieces of HTML. HCL will change the way that you create websites.

# How does HCL Work?
HCL works by using a function similar to auto correct, for every HCL line written, it will automatically convert that to the appropiate matching html line.

# What is HCL Editor?
HCL Editor is a piece of software currently in development. HCL editor is an editor that will have HCL compatibility built in and will give the user the most functionality of any editor with HCL and will be the first to use HCL.

# Documentation
Documentation for HCL will be released soon as I am still working on finalizing it and creating parts of the language.
